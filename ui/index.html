                <p> Welcome to Ace animal shelter - where we care for rescued kittens and puppies. Some may be strays with no one to help them, some that people have left behind or given up, and others may have been in bad situations. They will need a lot of love and care. We give them a home and a lot of TLC until they are healthy, and ready to be adopted.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you are looking for a loving pet or companion to adopt, this is the place. We'll make sure you have the best loving animal companion you've always wanted. 
                </p>
